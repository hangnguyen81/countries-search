# Countries search

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can fork the project directory to your local computer , you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In countries search app, I fetch data from 2 APIs: 
* [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all) - no API key required
* [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com) . This API needs key to fetch data. Therefore, you need to register as a member to get API key. To use their service, please read in their [document](https://weatherstack.com/documentation)

Due to GitHub environment page, my app in GitHub page still run smoothly with data of countries but the data from webstack cannot loaded. However, with correct api_key of weatherstack, it is functional perfectly in localhost environment
